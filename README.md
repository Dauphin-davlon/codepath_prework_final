Submitted by: David Alonge

Time spent: 22 hours spent in total

Link to project: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/vigorous-tungsten-toad?path=style.css%3A1%3A0

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [x] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [x] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [x] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)


## Video Walkthrough (GIF)

If you recorded multiple GIFs for all the implemented features, you can add them here:

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

While working on the prework project, I was exposed to many software and applications I had never used before. To start with, I used GitHub and glitch for the first time. In addition, the project got me interested in front-end development. The prework was a perfect project to introduce me to this. The steps and resources provided were really helpful. However, while submitting the project, I got to some stages where I wasn’t getting the result I wanted.
One of the challenges I faced was when I had to create a repository, commit and push using GitHub desktop. After successfully installing and logging in to my GitHub desktop account following the video guidance provided, I got confused about how to link the code in Glitch to Github. Since the resources so far were very detailed, I became too reliant on them. The video assumed that we downloaded the prework code from Glitch to our desktop. Downloading the prework code from Glitch to my desktop was a challenge. The format is downloaded in .tgz, and windows software doesn’t have a built-in application to handle this file format. I had to research this file format and the method to unzip this file.
Another challenge I faced was in creating a GIF showing the features I implemented. The resources provided were perfectly suitable for a MacBook user. However, the steps weren’t the same for window users like me. QuickTime player didn’t work. I tried using other steps, like screen recording, and software like shortcut app, but they came out blurry. I ended up using RecordIt after watching YouTube videos on how it works on the Windows system.
Finally, adding optional features poses challenges to me. This is because I have to fully understand the code to make changes to implement the additional features. I read about the code, used w3school to get more information about the syntax we used. Also, I explored and tried making small changes to parts of the code. Due to the relationship between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the changes caused errors but correcting them gave me more practice in understanding the code better.


3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

Before the prework project, I began learning HTML. I understand that HTML is used to create the website. Though I had not started exploring CSS, I knew that CSS is used for graphics and designs. However, I wasn’t aware of the role of JavaScript. The relationship between these languages was another thing that fascinated me. The way elements in HTML connect with the element in CSS and JavaScript using ID. This fascination caused me to have some questions about web development.
My question is about JavaScript and its similarities with JAVA. I realized that the part of the project we did with JavaScript was also possible with JAVA. Also, the syntaxes used were similar. It got me questioning why we need JAVA if JavaScript can perform these functions, while also connecting to the web design (HTML and CSS).
The other question I have about web development is how it connects to the back end. I understand that most times, data from the users still need to be stored in a database. I have learned how relational database works (MySQL). However, I am not comfortable with how the database is linked to the front end (HTML, CSS) to create a working environment.


4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

Given more time to work on the project, I would continue to challenge myself to finish the optional features. I would implement the last optional feature I was not able to implement.
Also, I would add features that would make the game more user-friendly and entertaining. I had some pretty interesting ideas. One of the projects I did in my computer science class was to keep track of users and the game records while they play "the Rock, Paper, Scissors" game. I plan to add this feature to the game. That is, the game will ask the user for their name for recognition and store it in a file. It will let them play and save their wins and losses in the file.
Another optional feature I would have liked to add was to make the look of the game more interesting. That is, more colors, add more pictures, videos, add design as the background. UI UX design plays a big role in the success of any application. Therefore, I will practice more about this by making the design more astatically pleasing.
If I had more hours and we could add features that affect the necessary implemented parts, I would try to make the game endless. Instead, it will have stages depending on the number of sounds you've successfully played back at once. The user starts with stage 1, where he has to remember just one sound and play it back. If he wins, he enters stage two, where it becomes two. It continues to three, four, and so on. In this way, there is no limit to just eight sounds.
